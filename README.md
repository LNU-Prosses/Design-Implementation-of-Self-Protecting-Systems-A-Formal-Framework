# Design-and-Implementation-of-Self-Protecting-Systems-A-Formal-Framework

## Contents
This repository contains input, attack graph and model files for the InsecureDocumentStore and ZNN experiments of Design and Implementation of Self-Protecting Systems:A Formal Framework.
The repository is divided into two directories one for each experiment. The directories have a similar structure,there exists one sub-directory for each experiment, named 0 to 4 for each adaptation pass.
Each experiment directory contains three directories: 
i) an input directory containing attack graph generation rules and input files, 
ii) an attack graph directory holding the attack graph generated by MULVAL and finally 
iii) an automata directory holding the UPPAAL models.

## How to use
In order to generate the attack graph files, first install MULVAL and sequently run $MULVALROOT/utils/graph_gen.sh -v -r   rules.P input.P  followed by $MULVALROOT/utils/graph_gen.sh
where $MULVALROOT is the root MULVAL folder as described in the MULVAL install instructions.
To run the UPPAAL files simply load the files in UPPAAL and click check on the verification panel or invoke verifyta $MODELFILE through the command line.
verifyta is located in the bin folder of the UPPAAL installation.
